# Here's a quick rundown of what KPI is all about:
- KPIs are specific and measurable metrics that help businesses or teams track progress towards their goals.
- They are used to evaluate performance and determine whether the goals set by the organization are being achieved.
- KPIs should be chosen based on the business objectives and should be relevant to the specific department or team.
- They are typically tracked through ongoing monitoring and reporting to ensure that the business is on track to reach its targets. ðŸš€
And as requested by Aleem, I have created this in Markdown format:
